## Short-term targets
My immediate aims the next time I open my computer
- [ ] Start the code, lay out the foundations.

## Long-term targets
My overall file aims
- [ ] Create a management system to read multiple potentiometers located in robot joints using limited analogue pins (clue: 1 analogue reader, binary tree of voltage pushers)
- [ ] Translate resistance into limb angle
- [ ] Receive data from Human accurately & decode using syntax
- [ ] Compare local Mirror limb angles to Human limb angles
- [ ] Design smooth negative feedback loop to adjust Mirror body to match Human body (clue: reduce sensitivity to avoid jittering)
- [ ] Allocate CPUs to the different tasks, using multiple boards (clue: OpenMP threads, MPI intercommunication)
- [ ] Code the special binary open/closed code for fingers to bypass potentiometer size restrictions

## Fancy targets
My extra fancy could-be aims if I had the time and effort (likely won't achieve these)
- [ ] Invest in rotary encoders
- [ ] Use an upgraded accelerometer module instead of potentiometer
