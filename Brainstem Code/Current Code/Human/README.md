## Short-term targets
My immediate aims the next time I open my computer
- [ ] Start the code, lay out the foundations.
- [ ] Investigate whether BMI270 is a viable option to replace MPU6050

## Long-term targets
My overall file aims
- [ ] Calibrate accelerometers
- [ ] Read accurately from accelerometers
- [ ] Create a transmission syntax
- [ ] Transmit information accurately via LoRa/WiFi with low latency

## Fancy targets
My extra fancy could-be aims if I had the time and effort (likely won't achieve these)
- [ ] Switch between LoRa, WiFi, and Bluetooth depending on signal strength to conserve energy and minimise latency
- [ ] Upgrade accelerometer module to BNO085 for a lower calibration time and less drift
